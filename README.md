### MSc Thesis _Aug 2010 - Jan 2011_
[Thesis video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Sm2NxJj1g)
My MSc. thesis was to investigate the capabilities of Open Source web GIS technologies and then compare them with Commercial web GIS technologies for a specific domain i.e. Control-Center/Crisis Cell spatial applications. The output was two web GIS applications, developed with commercial (**ArcGIS**) and Open Source web GIS software/libraries(**MapServer, PostgreSQL/PostGIS,OpenLayers,ExtUI**). The application provides latest situation awarness picture in a city by displaying emergency events (e.g. Robberies, Fighting, Fire etc), Police Patrols, fire engine on a single map with functionality of nearest police car/fire engine to an event. Metropolitan administration can assign police cars and fire engine to an event. Updates on an events are fed into the database and can be obtained by clicking on an event.
